    "SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language for defining and manipulating data.\n",
    "They have a predefined schema, which means the structure of the data (table names, column names, data types, relationships) must be defined before inserting data.\n",
    "Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that provide flexibility in handling unstructured and semi-structured data.\n",
    "They do not require a fixed schema, allowing you to insert data without first defining its structure.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are generally more scalable and better suited for handling large sets of distributed data.\n",
    "Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis."

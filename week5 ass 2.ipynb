    "Using the Exception class as the base class when creating custom exceptions in a programming language serves several important purposes. Custom exceptions are used to represent specific error conditions in your code that are not adequately covered by the standard exceptions provided by the language. Here's why you should use the Exception class as the base:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Hierarchy and Categorization: The Exception class is typically the root of the exception hierarchy in most programming languages. By deriving your custom exception from this class, you create a clear hierarchy that helps categorize and organize exceptions. This makes it easier for developers to understand the relationships between different exceptions and handle them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Consistency: By inheriting from the Exception class, you ensure that your custom exceptions adhere to the same conventions and behaviors as the built-in exceptions. This includes standard error handling practices such as try-catch blocks and exception chaining. Consistency in exception handling makes code maintenance and debugging more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Future Compatibility: If the language's exception handling mechanisms or practices change in the future, your custom exceptions are more likely to remain compatible and follow best practices if they are derived from the standard Exception class."

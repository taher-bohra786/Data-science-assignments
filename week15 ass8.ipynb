    "Grid Search CV searches all possible parameter combinations, while Randomized Search CV selects a subset randomly. Use Grid Search for small grids and Randomized Search for large, complex spaces.  \n",

    "Data leakage occurs when training data includes information from the test set, leading to overly optimistic performance. Example: Using future stock prices as features in a predictive model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4.**  \n",
    "Prevent data leakage by splitting data **before** preprocessing, using **pipeline-based transformations**, and ensuring features don't contain target information.  \n",

    "A confusion matrix shows **True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN)**, helping assess classification model performance.  \n",

    "By analyzing FP and FN values, you can determine whether your model is biased towards false positives (over-predicting) or false negatives (under-predicting).  \n",

    "Accuracy depends on TP and TN but can be misleading if the dataset is imbalanced, making precision and recall more reliable in such cases.  \n",

    "A confusion matrix can reveal bias if FP or FN rates are significantly higher for certain classes, indicating potential class imbalance or biased training data."

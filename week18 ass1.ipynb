    "A supervised learning algorithm that classifies or predicts based on the **K nearest neighbors** using distance metrics.  \n",

    "**Q2.**  \n",
    "Use **cross-validation**; small K leads to overfitting, large K to underfitting. A good rule of thumb is **K ≈ sqrt(N)**.  \n",

    "- **Regressor**: Predicts continuous values using the average of neighbors.  \n",

    "In high-dimensional data, distances become less meaningful, making KNN less effective. Use **PCA or feature selection** to reduce dimensions.  \n",

    "- **KNN classifier** is better for categorical problems like spam detection.  \n",
    "- **KNN regressor** is better for continuous problems like house price prediction but is sensitive to outliers.  \n",

    "**Q8.**  \n",
    "- **Strengths**: Simple, non-parametric, works well with small datasets.  \n",
    "- **Weaknesses**: Slow for large datasets, sensitive to irrelevant features, affected by high dimensions. **Solution**: Use KD-Trees, scaling, and dimensionality reduction.  \n",

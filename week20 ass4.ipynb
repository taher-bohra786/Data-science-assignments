    "### **Q1: What is meant by time-dependent seasonal components?**  \n",
    "Time-dependent seasonal components refer to seasonal patterns in time series data that **change over time** rather than remaining constant. Unlike fixed seasonal components, where patterns repeat in a predictable manner, time-dependent seasonal effects may **vary in amplitude, frequency, or timing** due to external influences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "- Retail sales may have a **strong seasonal component during holidays**, but the **intensity of sales may change over the years** due to economic conditions.\n",
    "- Temperature trends may **shift due to climate change**, altering seasonal behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2: How can time-dependent seasonal components be identified in time series data?**  \n",
    "Identifying time-dependent seasonality can be done using various techniques:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rolling Window Analysis:**  \n",
    "   - Compute rolling mean and standard deviation to see if seasonal effects vary over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time-Varying Spectral Analysis:**  \n",
    "   - Fourier transforms or wavelet analysis can help detect changing frequency components in the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL Decomposition):**  \n",
    "   - Breaks data into **trend, seasonal, and residual components** to check if seasonality is stable or changing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Autocorrelation (ACF) & Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) Plots:**  \n",
    "   - If seasonality weakens or shifts in different time windows, it suggests time-dependent seasonality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Machine Learning Approaches (e.g., Facebook Prophet):**  \n",
    "   - These models can handle non-constant seasonality by dynamically adjusting trends and seasonal variations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3: What are the factors that can influence time-dependent seasonal components?**  \n",
    "Several factors can cause seasonal patterns to change over time, including:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Economic Trends:** Changes in market demand, inflation, or recessions.\n",
    "- **Policy Changes:** Tax laws, government regulations affecting industries.\n",
    "- **Environmental Changes:** Climate change affecting seasonal weather patterns.\n",
    "- **Technological Advancements:** New shopping habits (e.g., shift to online shopping reducing holiday retail foot traffic).\n",
    "- **Demographic Shifts:** Changes in consumer behavior due to generational trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4: How are autoregression models used in time series analysis and forecasting?**  \n",
    "An **Autoregression (AR) model** predicts future values based on a linear combination of **past observations**.  \n",

    "\\]  \n",
    "where:  \n",
    "- \\( Y_t \\) is the value at time \\( t \\).\n",
    "- \\( p \\) is the number of lagged observations (order of AR).\n",
    "- \\( \\phi \\) are the model coefficients.\n",
    "- \\( \\epsilon_t \\) is white noise (random error).\n",

    "### **Q5: How do you use autoregression models to make predictions for future time points?**  \n",
    "To use an AR model for forecasting:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select the Order \\( p \\) of the Model:**  \n",
    "   - Use **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)** to determine lag order \\( p \\).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fit the AR Model:**  \n",
    "   - Estimate coefficients using **least squares regression** or **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Forecast Future Values:**  \n",
    "   - Use past values and model coefficients to predict future points iteratively.  \n",

    "4. **Assess Model Accuracy:**  \n",
    "   - Use metrics like **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), or BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)** to evaluate performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check Residuals:**  \n",
    "   - Ensure errors are normally distributed and uncorrelated to validate the model.  \n",
